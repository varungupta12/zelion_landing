						<h2>The Team</h2>
						<p>The team consists of three people, namely, Varun Gupta, Yash Prasad and Nilay Gupta, who have worked on quite a few successful projects together. They're undergrad students who aspire to become very successful in their lives. Their willingness to achieve the goal within the deadline is what makes this trio so strong. They have pretty good communication and management skills. Moreover, they almost always manage to resolve conflicts calmly and practically. They also look forward to constructive criticism. Yash and Varun come from the same city and they're first cousins by relation, whereas Nilay and Varun are college roommates, hence the bond that they share is pretty amazing. The co-ordination that they show is commendable as well.</p>
